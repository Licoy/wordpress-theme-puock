## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require orhanerday/open-ai
```

## Quick Start ⚡

Before you get starting, you should set OPENAI_API_KEY as ENV key, and set OpenAI key as env value with the following
commands;

_Powershell_

```powershell
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-gjtv....."
```

_Cmd_

```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-gjtv.....
```

_Linux or macOS_

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-gjtv.....
```

> Getting issues while setting up env? Please read
> the [article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety) or you can check
> my [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73904271/15196622) for the Windows® ENV setup.

Create your `index.php` file and paste the following code part into the file.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // remove this line if you use a PHP Framework.

use Orhanerday\OpenAi\OpenAi;

$open_ai_key = getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY');
$open_ai = new OpenAi($open_ai_key);

$chat = $open_ai->chat([
   'model' => 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
   'messages' => [
       [
           "role" => "system",
           "content" => "You are a helpful assistant."
       ],
       [
           "role" => "user",
           "content" => "Who won the world series in 2020?"
       ],
       [
           "role" => "assistant",
           "content" => "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."
       ],
       [
           "role" => "user",
           "content" => "Where was it played?"
       ],
   ],
   'temperature' => 1.0,
   'max_tokens' => 4000,
   'frequency_penalty' => 0,
   'presence_penalty' => 0,
]);


var_dump($chat);
echo "<br>";
echo "<br>";
echo "<br>";
// decode response
$d = json_decode($chat);
// Get Content
echo($d->choices[0]->message->content);
```

_Run the server with the following command_

```shell
php -S localhost:8000 -t .
```

## Usage

### Load your key from an environment variable.

> According to the following code `$open_ai` is the base variable for all open-ai operations.

```php
use Orhanerday\OpenAi\OpenAi;

$open_ai = new OpenAi(env('OPEN_AI_API_KEY'));
```

## Requesting organization

For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API
request.
Usage from these API requests will count against the specified organization's subscription quota.

````php
$open_ai_key = getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY');
$open_ai = new OpenAi($open_ai_key);
$open_ai->setORG("org-IKN2E1nI3kFYU8ywaqgFRKqi");
````

## Base URL

You can specify Origin URL with `setBaseURL()` method;

````php
$open_ai_key = getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY');
$open_ai = new OpenAi($open_ai_key,$originURL);
$open_ai->setBaseURL("https://ai.example.com/");
````

## Use Proxy

You can use some proxy servers for your requests api;

````php
$open_ai->setProxy("http://127.0.0.1:1086");
````

## Set header

 ```php
$open_ai->setHeader(["Connection"=>"keep-alive"]);
```

## Get cURL request info

> ### !!! WARNING:Your API key will expose if you add this method to your code, therefore remove the method before deployment. Be careful !
You can get cURL info after the request. 

````php
$open_ai = new OpenAi($open_ai_key);
echo $open_ai->listModels(); // you should execute the request FIRST!
var_dump($open_ai->getCURLInfo()); // You can call the request
````

## Chat (as known as ChatGPT API)

Given a chat conversation, the model will return a chat completion response.

 ```php
$complete = $open_ai->chat([
    'model' => 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    'messages' => [
        [
            "role" => "system",
            "content" => "You are a helpful assistant."
        ],
        [
            "role" => "user",
            "content" => "Who won the world series in 2020?"
        ],
        [
            "role" => "assistant",
            "content" => "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."
        ],
        [
            "role" => "user",
            "content" => "Where was it played?"
        ],
    ],
    'temperature' => 1.0,
    'max_tokens' => 4000,
    'frequency_penalty' => 0,
    'presence_penalty' => 0,
]);
```

## Accessing the Element 

```php
<?php
// Dummy Response For Chat API 
$j = '
{
   "id":"chatcmpl-*****",
   "object":"chat.completion",
   "created":1679748856,
   "model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
   "usage":{
      "prompt_tokens":9,
      "completion_tokens":10,
      "total_tokens":19
   },
   "choices":[
      {
         "message":{
            "role":"assistant",
            "content":"This is a test of the AI language model."
         },
         "finish_reason":"length",
         "index":0
      }
   ]
}
';

// decode response
$d = json_decode($j);

// Get Content
echo($d->choices[0]->message->content);
```

## Completions

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions, and can also return the probabilities of
alternative tokens at each position.

 ```php
$complete = $open_ai->completion([
    'model' => 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct',
    'prompt' => 'Hello',
    'temperature' => 0.9,
    'max_tokens' => 150,
    'frequency_penalty' => 0,
    'presence_penalty' => 0.6,
]);
```

### Stream Example

This feature might sound familiar from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

<hr>

#### ChatGPT Clone Project

Video of demo:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22305274/219878695-c76a58c0-5081-402c-a1b5-2b1fd971735a.mp4

ChatGPT clone is a simple web application powered by the OpenAI library and built with PHP. It allows users to chat with
an AI language model that responds in real-time. Chat history is saved using cookies, and the project requires the use
of an API key and enabled SQLite3.

Url of The ChatGPT-Clone Repo https://github.com/orhanerday/ChatGPT

<hr>

Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as
data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format)
as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.

 ````php
$open_ai = new OpenAi(env('OPEN_AI_API_KEY'));

$opts = [
    'prompt' => "Hello",
    'temperature' => 0.9,
    "max_tokens" => 150,
    "frequency_penalty" => 0,
    "presence_penalty" => 0.6,
    "stream" => true,
];

header('Content-type: text/event-stream');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache');

$open_ai->completion($opts, function ($curl_info, $data) {
    echo $data . "<br><br>";
    echo PHP_EOL;
    ob_flush();
    flush();
    return strlen($data);
});

````

Add this part inside `<body>` of the HTML

 ````php
 
<div id="divID">Hello</div>
<script>
    var eventSource = new EventSource("/");
    var div = document.getElementById('divID');


    eventSource.onmessage = function (e) {
       if(e.data == "[DONE]")
       {
           div.innerHTML += "<br><br>Hello";
       }
        div.innerHTML += JSON.parse(e.data).choices[0].text;
    };
    eventSource.onerror = function (e) {
        console.log(e);
    };
</script>
````

You should see a response like the in video;

provided query.

```php
$search = $open_ai->search([
    'engine' => 'ada',
    'documents' => ['White House', 'hospital', 'school'],
    'query' => 'the president',
]);

Given a question, a set of documents, and some examples, the API generates an answer to the question based on the
information in the set of documents. This is useful for question-answering applications on sources of truth, like
company documentation or a knowledge base.

  ```php
$answer = $open_ai->answer([
    'documents' => ['Puppy A is happy.', 'Puppy B is sad.'],
    'question' => 'which puppy is happy?',
    'search_model' => 'ada',
    'model' => 'curie',
    'examples_context' => 'In 2017, U.S. life expectancy was 78.6 years.',
    'examples' => [['What is human life expectancy in the United States?', '78 years.']],
    'max_tokens' => 5,
    'stop' => ["\n", '<|endoftext|>'],
]);
```

> OpenAI developed new methods with better
> performance. [Learn more.](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272941-classifications-transition-guide)

Given a query and a set of labeled examples, the model will predict the most likely label for the query. Useful as a
drop-in replacement for any ML classification or text-to-label task.

 ```php
$classification = $open_ai->classification([
    'examples' => [
        ['A happy moment', 'Positive'],
        ['I am sad.', 'Negative'],
        ['I am feeling awesome', 'Positive'],
    ],
    'labels' => ['Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral'],
    'query' => 'It is a raining day =>(',
    'search_model' => 'ada',
    'model' => 'curie',
]);
```

## Content Moderations

Given a input text, outputs if the model classifies it as violating OpenAI's content policy.

```php
$flags = $open_ai->moderation([
    'input' => 'I want to kill them.'
]);
```

Know more about Content Moderations here: [OpenAI Moderations](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations)

## List engines

**_(Deprecated)_**

> The Engines endpoints are deprecated.
> Please use their replacement, [Models](#list-models), instead. [Learn more](TODO?).

Lists the currently available engines, and provides basic information about each one such as the owner and availability.

 ```php
$engines = $open_ai->engines();
```

## Audio

### Create Transcription

Transcribes audio into the input language.

```php
$c_file = curl_file_create(__DIR__ . '/files/en-marvel-endgame.m4a');

$result = $open_ai->transcribe([
    "model" => "whisper-1",
    "file" => $c_file,
]);
```
#### Response

```json
{

Yeah, just like that. Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this, I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try. If we do this, how do we know it's going to end any differently than it did before? Because before you didn't have me. Hey, little girl, everybody in this room is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time? There are a lot of other planets in the universe. But unfortunately, they didn't have you guys. I like this one. Let's go get this son of a bitch."

### Create Translation

Translates audio into English.

_I use Turkish voice for translation thanks to famous science YouTuber [Barış Özcan](https://youtu.be/r2dQgdktUJg?t=90)_

```php
$c_file = curl_file_create(__DIR__ . '/files/tr-baris-ozcan-youtuber.m4a');

$result = $open_ai->translate([
    "model" => "whisper-1",
    "file" => $c_file,
]);
```
#### Response 

```json
{
  "text": "GPT-3. Last month, the biggest leap in the world of artificial intelligence in recent years happened silently. Maybe the biggest leap of all time. GPT-3's beta version was released by OpenAI. When you hear such a sentence, you may think, what kind of leap is this? But be sure, this is the most advanced language model with the most advanced language model with the most advanced language ability. It can answer these artificial intelligence questions, it can translate and even write poetry. Those who have gained access to the API or API of GPT-3 have already started to make very interesting experiments. Let's look at a few examples together. Let's start with an example of aphorism. This site produces beautiful words that you can tweet. Start to actually do things with your words instead of just thinking about them."
